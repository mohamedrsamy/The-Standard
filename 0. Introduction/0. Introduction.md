This is The Standard. A collection of decades of experience in the engineering industry. I authored it for you to find your way in the wide ocean of knowledge. The Standard is not perfect, and never will be. It reflects the ongoing evolution in the engineering industry. Whilst it may be written by one person, it is actually the collection of thoughts from hundreds of engineers that I've had the honor to interact with throughtout my life and learn from.

The Standard holds hundreds of years of collective experiences from so many different engineers. As I travelled the world and worked in so many industries, I've had the chance to work with so many different types of engineers - some of them were mad scientists who would bother with the smallest details of every single routine. And some others are business-engineers who care more about the end results than the means to get to these results. Among many others, I've learned from all of them what makes a simple engineering guide, that can light up the way for all other engineers to be inspired by it and hopefully follow it. And therefore I made this Standard hoping for it to be a compass for all of us engineers to use to find the best way to engineer solutions that would hopefully change the world.

This Standard is an appeal to the engineers all over the world, to read through it and make extracts of their experieneces and knowledge to enrich an engineering Standard worthy of the industry of software. We live today knowing the origins of the earth, of man and all the animals. We know how hot boiling water is. How long a yard. Our ships' masters know the precise measurements of latitude and longitude. Yet we have neither chart nor compass to guide us through the wide sea of code. The time has come to accord this great craft of ours the same dignity and respect as the other standards defined by science.

The value of this Standard is so immense to those who are still finding their way in this industry, or even those who lost their way to guide them towards a better future. But more importantly The Standard is written for everyone, equally, to inspire every engineer or engineer-to-be to look forward to focusing on what matters the most about engineering. its purpose not its technicalities. I have realized when engineers have any form of standard, they start focusing more on what can be accomplished in our world today. And when a team of engineers follow some form of standard, their energy and focus becomes more about what can be accomplished not how it should be accomplished.

I collected then authored this Standard hoping it will eliminate much of the confusion, and focus the efforts of the engineers on what matters the most. Using technology as a mean to have higher purposes and establish its equivelant of goals. Designing software has come along way, and it has proven itself to be one of the most powerful tools a person could have today. This craft deserves a proper way to be introduced to the world, and to be educated to the youth.

At its essence, The Standard is my intrepretation of SOLID principles along with many other practices and patterns that continue to enrich our designs and development to achieve truly solid systems. The Standard is aiming to help every engineer find a guidance in doing their day to day work. But more importantly ensure every engineers that when they need to build rugged systems that can land on the moon, solve the most complex problems and ensure the survival of the human kind and its evolution.

The Standard is also a work of love to the rest of the world. Driven and written with a passion to enhance the engineering experience and producing efficient, rugged, configurable, pluggable and reliabale systems that can withstand any challenges or changes as it occurs almost on daily basis in our industry.
